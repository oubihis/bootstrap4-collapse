Just all the css and js you need from Bootstrap4 to implement their
collapse functionality.

See documentation here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/

To re-create from scratch, run `npm install`
followed by `gulp build`. This creates 4 files:
* `dist/css/collapse.css`
* `dist/css/collapse.min.css`
* `dist/css/collapse.js`
* `dist/css/collapse.min.js`

To use:
1. include `dist/css/collapse.css` or `dist/css/collapse.min.css` as a stylesheet
2. include `jquery` in your page scripts
2. include `dist/js/collapse.js` or `dist/js/collapse.min.js` in your page scripts
